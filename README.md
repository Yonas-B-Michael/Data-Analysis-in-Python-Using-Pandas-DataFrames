The project is to import JSON data into a Pandas dataframe and apply the data preparation process to ensure the data is ready for analysis. 
To achieve this, we will explore the famous IMDb Movies dataset. We will start with importing our JSON data into a Pandas data frame. 
After applying some data preparation steps such as dropping and renaming some columns, we are going to start our data analysis by answering some analytical questions about the dataset.
This Project is unique as it focuses on how to use Pandas functions to filter, clean, aggregate, and visualize data.
